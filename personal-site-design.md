What is you site's primary purpose?

To document, showcase and follow the story of my journey through EDA through blog posts and projects- an EDA digital portfolio if you will.

Who is your target audience?
My target audience is the EDA teachers of course- my cohort, my partner, my family-
Possibly anyone who might be interested in studying at EDA and wants to check out some students examples.

 How do you want site visitors to interact with your site? What experience would you like them to have?
I want them to be able to navigate their way through the site easily and for it to have a good flow
I would like the layout and styling to be sophisticated, tidy and easy to read/follow whilst being responsive on all devices.


How will you build your site to support your desired user experience?
I will use the skeleton framework, making it responsive and using the ‘mobile first’ approach, and incorporate all I’ve learnt from HTML and CSS.
